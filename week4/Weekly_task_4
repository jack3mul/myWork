# This program is my submission for weekly task 4
# The program requests an input - a positive number and then completes a series of calculations 
# until the number is equal to 1
# If the current value is even, the program divides it by 2
# If the current value is odd, the program multiplies it by 3 and adds 1
# The values are all printed in a line as output  
# Author Kieran Mullany
